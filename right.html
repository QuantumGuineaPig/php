"Right," said David, "Both of us together
One each end and steady as we go."
Tried to admit it, couldn't even believe it
We was gettin' corrected
And so Bea said 'left' for the hundreth time today

"Up," said David, "Give a shout for Charlie."
Up comes Charlie from the floor below
After strainin', face-palmin' and complainin'
We was gettin' corrected
And Bea said to say "Down" again!

And Charlie had a think, and they thought we ought to say drago-n
//Up to here
And the things wot held the candles
But it did no good, well I never thought it would

"All right," said Fred, "Have to take the feet off
To get them feet off wouldn't take a mo."
Took its feet off, even took the seat off
Should have got us somewhere but no!
So Fred said, "Let's have another cuppa tea."
And we said, "right-o."
